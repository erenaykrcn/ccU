This is my proposal for reducing the overhead of implementing the controlled time evolution operator (controlled-U) by using a Riemannian Trust Region protocol. Controlled-U constitutes the bottleneck for a hardware friendly implementation of Quantum Phase Estimation. Main promise of my proposed algorithm is to enable larger Trotter steps for low approximation errors, enabling a hardware implementation of QPE on non-integrable quantum models up to 16 qubits under realistic hardware noise. Core idea is to run the optimization for translationally invariant Hamiltonians with exactly diagonalizable, small system sizes (e.g. 4 qubits) and employ these same gates on larger systems.

![Trotter Error and Gate Count comparison with respect to total simulation time of controlled time evolution operator of 1D anisotropic Heisenberg model of 10 sites (with non-zero external fields in all 3 directions). Trotter method is based on using the idea of inserting controlled Pauli strings, explained in Sec. \ref{sec:sec2}. Trotter step for ccU is set to 0.25 and its gates were optimized on a 4 qubit model with $(\gamma, \eta) = (6, 2)$, meaning 16 layers in total with 6 of them being controlled by the ancilla. Trotter step for the Trotterized approach was set to 0.1. One can observe that 3rd order Trotter formula delivers a larger Trotter error at more than double the gate counts of the ccU.](https://github.com/erenaykrcn/ccU/blob/main/examples/heisenberg1d/figs/heisenberg1d_111_trotter_and_cxs.pdf)



![Simulation of iterative QPE for digits $k \in \{-2, -1, 0\}$, on the 1D anisotropic Heisenberg model of 10 qubits. I terminate the iterative protocol once the amplitude of the estimated phase falls below a certain treshold (set to 0.1 for this example) - indicating total depolarization. The dashed, blue line indicates the step, one would have to reject from the sequence, due to the phase amplitude falling below the treshold. We observe that ccU could deliver one further successful stage at k=0, reducing the accuracy and errorbar of the end result compared to the Trotterized approach. In this simulation, two qubit gate depolarizing probability was set to $10^{-3}$.](https://github.com/erenaykrcn/ccU/blob/main/examples/heisenberg1d/figs/heisenberg1d_111_qpe.pdf)
