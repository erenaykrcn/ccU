# Riemannian Circuit Optimization for Controlled Time Evolution Operator

![](https://github.com/erenaykrcn/ccU/blob/main/examples/heisenberg1d/figs/ccU_tikz-1.png)
This is my proposal for reducing the overhead of implementing the controlled time evolution operator (controlled-U) by using a Riemannian Trust Region protocol. Controlled-U constitutes the bottleneck for a hardware friendly implementation of Quantum Phase Estimation. Main promise of my proposed algorithm is to enable larger Trotter steps for low approximation errors, enabling a hardware implementation of QPE on non-integrable quantum models up to 16 qubits under realistic hardware noise. Core idea is to run the optimization for translationally invariant Hamiltonians with exactly diagonalizable, small system sizes (e.g. 4 qubits) and employ these same gates on larger systems.

Ground state energy estimations of the antiferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model with various field strengths on a triangular 4×4 lattice. I interpolate between the asymptotic linear behavior of the energy at large field strengths and the classical energy to qualitatively estimate the pseudo–phase transition point ($g_c$). I obtained the energy estimations from the noise-aware emulator of the Quantinuum H2 device, using 184 hardware-native ZZPhase gates per phase estimation circuit.

(a) Evolution infidelity and gate count comparison of the controlled time evolution of different systems on 4x4 square and triangular lattices (2D TFIM and Heisenberg), as well as a linear chain of 20 qubits (1D Heisenberg), for different evolution times $t \in [0.125, 1]$. Solid lines represent infidelities of the compressed circuit, while dashed lines represent second order Trotter splitting. Trotter method is based on using the idea of inserting controlled Pauli strings. For the 1D Heisenberg, TICC gates were optimized on a 6 qubit model. (b) Upper bounds on evolution infidelity for TFIM on 6x6 square lattice, obtained through PEPS simulations of bond dimension $\chi \in (1, 2, 3)$. Solid line represents results obtained from applying the optimized gates (optimized on a 4x4 lattice) and dashed line represents second order Trotter splitting (of comparable gate count).
